description: How to Create and Share a Custom Job Form
---

This workflow guides you through the process of creating a custom operational form (like an inspection checklist or safety pre-start) and sharing it with field workers.

### 1. Structure the Form
1. Navigate to the **Job System** from the sidebar.
2. Ensure you are on the **Create Form** tab.
3. Add a **Title** (e.g., "Daily Pre-Start Check") and a brief **Description**.
4. Use the **Elements Panel** on the left to add fields:
   - Use **Heading** to group related questions.
   - Use **Checkbox** for confirmation items.
   - Use **Signature Pad** for final sign-off.
   - Use **Image Upload** if evidence or photos are required.
5. Reorder fields by dragging the handle on the left of each field.
6. Mark critical fields as **Required**.

### 2. Preview and Save
1. Click the **Preview** button to see how the form will look for a worker.
2. Switch back to edit if changes are needed.
3. Click **Save Template**. You will be redirected to the **Management** tab.

### 3. Share with Workers
1. In the **Management** tab, locate your new form template.
2. Click the **Link Icon** (🔗) to copy the unique shareable URL.
3. Send this link to your workers via email, SMS, or QR code.
   - **Note:** Workers do NOT need to log in to fill out this form.

### 4. Monitor Submissions
1. When a worker submits a form, a toast notification will appear in your dashboard (if open).
2. To view the data, go to the **Management** tab and click the **Data Icon** (📊) on the corresponding template.
3. Click any submission row to view the full details, including captured photos and signatures.
